Host:    DESKTOP-UME8M8L (AVX512, FMA3, 11 GB RAM)
Command: C:\Users\usuario\OneDrive\Escritorio\iqtree-2.3.4-Windows\iqtree-2.3.4-Windows\bin\iqtree2.exe -s alin.aln-fasta -m GTR+G -b 1000
Seed:    180849 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Jun 26 10:10:59 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file alin.aln-fasta ... Fasta format detected
